# OmniGUI
A cross-platform GUI framework from scratch just to learn...

.. that is already AWESOME!

Xamarin Forms is OK, but has too many limitations.

What about having a Presentation Framework that:
- Load from the same XAML for every platform?
- It looks exactly the same in every platform?

OmniGUI is the *answer*
