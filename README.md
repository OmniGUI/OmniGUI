A cross-platform GUI framework from scratch just to learn.... that is already AWESOME!

# Xamarin Forms is OK, but has too many limitations

What about having a Presentation Framework that:
- Loads the UI from the same XAML for every platform?
- It looks exactly the same in every platform?

OmniGUI is **the answer**

# Some facts
- **You can use OmniGUI inside you Xamarin Forms/Native** project because OmniGUI **renders inside a view**, like any other control :)
- OmniGUI's XAML looks similar to WPF/UWP/Silverlight 
- Uses Reactive Programming. *Be Reactive, my friend.*
- MVVM-ready. The controls in each platform have BindingContext (DataContext) to attach to your ViewModels and use `Bindings`
- It currently runs on 
   - Windows Desktop
   - Android
   - iOS
   - Universal Windows Platform
   - Linux
   - more platforms with a few touches :)
