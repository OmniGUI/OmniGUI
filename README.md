# OmniGUI
A cross-platform GUI framework from scratch just to learn...
.. that is already AWESOME!

# Xamarin Forms is OK, but has too many limitations.

What about having a Presentation Framework that:
- Loads the UI from the same XAML for every platform?
- It looks exactly the same in every platform?

OmniGUI is the *answer*

Some basics:
- OmniGUI's XAML looks similar to WPF/UWP/SilverLight 
- Uses Reactive Programming. *Be Reactive*, my friend.
- Runs on 
   - Windows Desktop
   - Android
   - iOS
   - Universal Windows Platform
