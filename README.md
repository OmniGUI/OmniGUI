A cross-platform GUI framework from scratch just to learn...
.. that is already AWESOME!

# Xamarin Forms is OK, but has too many limitations.

What about having a Presentation Framework that:
- Loads the UI from the same XAML for every platform?
- It looks exactly the same in every platform?

OmniGUI is **the answer**

Some basics:
- OmniGUI's XAML looks similar to WPF/UWP/SilverLight 
- Uses Reactive Programming. *Be Reactive, my friend.*
- MVVM-ready.
- Runs on 
   - Windows Desktop
   - Android
   - iOS
   - Universal Windows Platform
   - more platforms with a few touches :)
